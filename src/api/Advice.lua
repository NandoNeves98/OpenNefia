--- Advice system.
---
--- This allows you to add new code to existing functions that don't have event
--- hooks defined. You can modify any function in the public API or defined on
--- classes this way.
---
--- Some caveats:
---   - It only works on publicly exported functions in modules or classes,
---     since it hooks into the module loading system. You can't use it on
---     things like callbacks inside data definitions (though it might be
---     possible to implement this at some point).
---   - You have to be sure the function's return values and arguments match
---     those of the advised functions you add. This could change because of
---     updates to the engine or mods.
---   - You can break all sorts of things by adding buggy code to heavily-used
---     API functions. However, it's possible to disable all advice on a
---     function by calling `Advice.remove_all(Module.some_function)` on it.
---
--- Example:
---
--- ```lua
--- local map = Map.current()
--- Calc.calc_object_level(10, map) -- 10
---
--- function double_map_level(orig_fn, base, map)
---    return orig_fn(base, map) * 2
--- end
--- Advice.add("around", Calc.calc_object_level, "Double the level of map enemies/items", double_map_level)
--- Calc.calc_object_level(10, map) -- 20
---
--- Advice.remove(Calc.calc_object_level, "Double the level of map enemies/items")
--- Calc.calc_object_level(10, map) -- 10
--- ```
